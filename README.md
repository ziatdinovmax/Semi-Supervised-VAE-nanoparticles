# Semi-Supervised-VAE-nanoparticles

Codes (and data) for reproducing the results of the paper [**Semi-supervised learning of images with strong rotational disorder: assembling nanoparticle libraries, arXiv: 2105.11475**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11475).

***ssrVAE_paper_synthetic.ipynb*** - This notebook demonstrates how to use a variational autoencoder (VAE) in a semi-supervised-setting to generalize from a small subset of labeled data with the weak orientational disorder to a large volume of unlabelled data with a much stronger orientational disorder.
